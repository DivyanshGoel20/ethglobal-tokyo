 * `commitArcRepayment` books it on the facility and the loan ledger.
 *
 *   agent wallet    the agent's USDC moves to the treasury, then it is booked
 *   browser wallet  a verified transfer receipt, then it is booked
 *   card            Stripe says the human paid (Apple Pay, Google Pay, card);
 *                   no USDC moves - Lifeline was paid in dollars - so only the
